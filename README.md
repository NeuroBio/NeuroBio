## Live Personal Projects
Ordered newest to oldest
- [Under Flotsam](https://under-flotsam.web.app/)
  - More interactive than a novel, less imagery than a visual novel, this game may be best described as "Visually Enhanced Reading."  You play as budding paranormal detective, Felix Battiste.  Extract clues from Leads and then investigate them by Searching at Locations or Interrogating your Contacts about them to gain new Leads to build up Theories.
- [Ballast Visual Novel Engine](https://neurobio.github.io/Ballast-Visual-Novel-Engine/)
  - I wanted my own VN engine to eventually fold into my Arecace project when I revisit it.  This demo tacks a minimal UI onto the engine, but ultimately what this package release is just the engine to handle the stand branching story patterns of a VN as well as Inventory Mangement, Achievements, and "Character Memories" a system to allow to swapping sprites and the exact options or text options a player gets as they navigate from one chapter to the next.
  - There is also a related Ballast Visual Novel Engine UI package (private currently) that builds a fairly customizable UI out of webcomponents.  That is WIP and not ready to show yet.
- [Pokemon Card Database](https://carddatabase-6dfef.web.app/Masterlist)
  - A place to catalogue my pokemon card collection.  There's over 20K entries so give this some time to load.  To say this is the first time I truly realized the impact large data can have on performance would be an understatement.
- [Song Evolution Model](https://neurobio.github.io/SEMWebApp/release/SEMWebApp/dist/)
  - A WASM project using Blazer to shove the C# Dotnet app I build to simulate bird song evolution in reesponse to evolutionary pressures online. 
- [Arecace](https://arecace.com/home)
  - Website for my comic/novel/art worldbuilding project, Arecace.  It's the kind of hard fantasy that strives to feel more like sci fi.
